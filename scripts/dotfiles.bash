# In my case, I usually put my dotfiles into a subfolder (lib/, dev/, etc.)
# inside my $HOME.
#
# I also have a `.stow-global-ignore` for `stow`, which needs a re-link.
#
# So, first thing first: `restow stow`
#.
# Restow means `DELETE` the link, then `STOW` (lin) it again.

stow -R atom

stow -R git
stow -R tig
stow -R vim

# Warning: `--no-folding` is mandatory for fisherman.
# fisherman **will not work** if the _whole folder_ is symlinked.
# We only need to link the `fishfile`. Everything else must be ignored.
